The aim of this project was to implement a spinoff of the classic game "Tetris". This variant of the game allows players to freely place their pieces, without waiting for them to fall into place. This offers for some interesting placement opportunities, as players could decide to interlock pieces if their shape allowed for it.

The project involved creating and hosting rooms for players to chat and play together, ensuring that the pieces that each of the players received for their turn was the same as the other player's.

The project was written in a Java Maven project, with the UI being written in JavaFX.
